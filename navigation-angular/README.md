# NavigationAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.6.

navigation-angular is an implementation of a simple TO-DO list that allow the user to add movies, read them, update them or delete them. This is done with the help of [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io).

The user can click in any of the movies to display its details. Once you are inside the details, you can update it notes with funny facts about the movie or your opinions about it.

If you are eager to increase your list, then you can navigate to the "Add movie" section, where you must fill all the fields (excepts "notes") to add a new movie.

Finally, if you want to remove one movie of your list, you can click on the trash button.
